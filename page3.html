		<p>Hello again! if you're here, it is because you are curious about me and my life.
		Good thing I am an open book, and can share some things about myself with you today.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am a Brazilian <link href="https://emoji-css.afeld.me/emoji.css" rel="stylesheet"><i class="em em-flag-br" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="Brazil Flag"></i> who considers Japan <link href="https://emoji-css.afeld.me/emoji.css" rel="stylesheet"><i class="em em-jp" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="Japan Flag"></i> as their home. Growing up in that beautiful country helped
		me become the woman that I am today. From learning traditional cultures and ancient manners to
		living in big cities and seeing how time has changed the country, I have experienced everything that
		I could possibly imagine in Japan.
		<br>
		<br>
		I have also lived in China <link href="https://emoji-css.afeld.me/emoji.css" rel="stylesheet"><i class="em em-cn" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="China Flag"></i> for two years, where I experienced culture shock for the first time. Not only I was in a
		country in which I could somehow read some of the text (for being the same as Japanese) but did not speak the language
		itself, I also had to learn a third language to survive in an international school. My mother refused to homeschool me,
		knowing that I was someone that would make studying my last priority at the time.
		<br>
		<br>
			And now I am here in the United States <link href="https://emoji-css.afeld.me/emoji.css" rel="stylesheet"><i class="em em-flag-um" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="U.S. Outlying Islands Flag"></i>
			studying journalism and trying to figure out my future.
			<br>
			<br>
			I love researching about cinema and TV, and that's when my writing skills come in handy. A fun fact about me is that
			I started a research paper on feminism and the portray of female characters in Hollywood JUST to apply to SAIC. And I easily
			wrote twelve pages on this topic. And I continue researching and analysing shows just for this purpose.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p class="now">Currently watching: Shameless <br>
			Last Movie (re)watched: Me Before You </p>
